        <h2>Show me the money!</h2>
        <p>The game is planned to release on itch.io under a cheap price (~$5) and possibly on Steam later on in the life time.</p>
        <p>A demo will be released on Newgrounds to help with promotion</p>
        <p>With it being a rhythm game, the soundtrack will also be able to be downloaded in its highest quality .wav formats for a fee.</p>
        <p>Selling the .FLPs (music project files) for songs could also be a point of revenue.</p>
